# NCSU
NCSU projects

This repository is generally to hold any projects I do as a student at NCSU. 

Hopefully, it will help me keep track of revision history and keep me from having to defend myself if something gets flagged as AI - I avoid going to AI for help on things unless I need a fresh explanation of a general concept. I avoid it at all costs when it comes to projects where I should already know the material necessary to complete them, so I'm hoping this helps in case anyone gets the wrong idea. 

I also want to be able to come back to these projects in the future! Hence why this is not a repository made with my student account.

Lastly, it would be nice to have a github page to serve as a portfolio. That would be nice.
